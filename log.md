### Day 0: September 14, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Reading 'Hands on Machine Learning" by Aurelien Geron and setup my machine to focus on chapter 2 the 'End-to-End' project. 

**Thoughts:** I knew ML would be a challenge, but with the available resouces do help.

### Day 1: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on KhanAcademy.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
